## Eclipse - Working with Git

In this exercise, you are going to clone a Github repo into VSTS and then open clone it to your VM for editing in Eclipse.
This exercise assumes you have completed Exercise 1, and have created a Team Project that uses Git for version control. This exercise uses a team project named **jdev**, though your team project name may differ.

> **Note**: It is not necessary to clone Github repos into VSTS. VSTS will work just fine with Github (or other Git hoster) repos. However, some linkages from source code to other aspects of the DevOps pipeline (such as work items, builds or releases) work best if the code is in VSTS.
